    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Ramadan in Jordan is a time of spiritual reflection, community, and extraordinary hospitality. In 2026, Ramadan is expected to begin around <strong>February 17-18</strong> and conclude with the Eid al-Fitr celebrations around <strong>March 18-19</strong>. While the pace of life changes, it offers travelers a unique opportunity to witness authentic Jordanian culture.</p>

      <h2>What to Expect During the Day</h2>
      <p>During the daylight hours, the pace of life in Jordan slows down. Most locals are fasting from dawn until sunset. You'll find that many local restaurants and cafes remain closed during the day, reopening with a burst of energy after sunset. However, in tourist-heavy areas like <strong>Petra, Wadi Rum, and Aqaba's resorts</strong>, many establishments continue to serve food and drinks normally.</p>
      
      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>Local Tip:</strong> It's a good idea to carry a small supply of water and snacks for the day, especially if you're traveling between cities.
      </div>

      <h2>The Magic of Iftar</h2>
      <p><strong>Iftar</strong> is the meal that breaks the fast at sunset. It's a joyous occasion where families gather to share traditional dishes. In Aqaba and across Jordan, you'll see a beautiful custom of hospitality where locals offer dates and water to passersby—including travelers—to break their fast. The streets come alive after sunset, with restaurants and cafes staying open late into the night.</p>

      <h2>Respect and Etiquette</h2>
      <p>To show respect for those fasting, it is recommended to avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public places during daylight hours. Dressing modestly (covering shoulders and knees) is always appreciated, but especially during this holy month. When taking photos, particularly during Iftar, always ask for permission first.</p>

      <h2>Where to Eat in Aqaba During the Day</h2>
      <p>If you're in Aqaba during the day, several places remain open for tourists:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Seven Spices Indian Restaurant:</strong> Open for tourists.</li>
        <li><strong>Ayla Oasis:</strong> Most shops and restaurants function as usual.</li>
        <li><strong>Berenice Beach Club:</strong> Bars and restaurants remain open.</li>
        <li><strong>International Chains:</strong> Places like McDonald's operate normally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is it Worth Visiting During Ramadan?</h2>
      <p>Absolutely! Visiting Jordan during Ramadan allows you to see the country through a different lens. You'll experience a level of hospitality that is truly unique to this time of year. From the festive atmosphere after sunset to the quiet beauty of the mornings, it's a journey you won't forget.</p>
