    "content": "Aqaba, Jordan's only coastal city, is often seen as just a gateway to the Red Sea or a stopover on the way to Petra and Wadi Rum. However, for those who venture beyond the resorts, Aqaba offers a rich tapestry of authentic culture, history, and incredible local experiences. If you are looking for the true heart of the city, forget the tourist traps. Here is The Ultimate Local's Guide to Things to Do in Aqaba, curated to help you discover the hidden gems and genuine hospitality of this vibrant port city. 1. Dive Deep into the Old Town and Local Souks: The most authentic way to experience Aqaba is on foot, away from the modern developments. The old town is a maze of history and commerce, where the pulse of local life beats strongest. The Souks (Markets): Forget sterile gift shops; the Aqaba souks are where locals shop for everything from fresh produce and spices to gold and traditional clothing. Don't miss the Spice Souk for the best Za'atar and the Fish Souk to see the day's catch from the Red Sea. This is the perfect place to practice your bargaining skills and interact with local vendors. Historical Gems: While walking, you can stumble upon sites like the Aqaba Fort (Mamluk Castle), which offers a glimpse into the city's strategic past, and the beautiful Sharif Hussein Bin Ali Mosque. These sites are often less crowded than the beaches and provide a deep connection to the city's heritage. Local Tip: The best way to navigate the old town and understand the stories behind the architecture and the people is with a knowledgeable guide. Our [Aqaba Walking Tour](walkingtour.html) is specifically designed to uncover these hidden alleys and local secrets, giving you an immersive, authentic experience. 2. Savor the Authentic Flavors of Jordanian Cuisine: Aqaba’s culinary scene is a delicious fusion of Bedouin, Levantine, and coastal influences. Experiencing the food is non-negotiable when looking for things to do in Aqaba. Street Food Delights: Head to the local street vendors for the best falafel, hummus, and the local favorite, Knafeh (a sweet cheese pastry). The food stalls near the downtown area are a hub of activity in the evenings. Eating where the locals eat is always the best sign of quality and authenticity. Master the Local Dishes: The ultimate culinary experience is learning to cook the food yourself. Dishes like Mansaf (Jordan's national dish) and Maqluba (the famous 'upside-down' dish) are staples of Jordanian hospitality. Local Tip: Instead of just eating, learn the secrets! Our [Authentic Jordanian Cooking Class](cookingclass.html) invites you into a local home kitchen where you can master these traditional dishes with a local chef. It's a hands-on, fun, and delicious way to take a piece of Jordan home with you. For a more relaxed evening, consider a [Traditional Dining Experience](dinningexperience.html) where you can share a home-cooked meal with a local family. 3. Explore the Underwater Wonders of the Red Sea: While the Red Sea attracts many tourists, you can still find unique, local ways to enjoy its beauty without the crowds. The Coral Reefs: Aqaba is famous for its pristine coral reefs and unique underwater attractions, including the sunken C-130 Hercules plane and the Cedar Pride shipwreck. While diving and snorkeling are popular, you don't have to get wet to appreciate the marine life. Glass-Bottom Boat Tours: For a family-friendly and relaxing experience, a glass-bottom boat tour offers a perfect view of the colorful coral and fish. It's a fantastic way to see the vibrant ecosystem of the Aqaba Marine Park. Local Tip: Look for smaller, locally-operated boats for a more personalized experience. Our [Aqaba Glass Boat Tour](glassboat.html) is a fantastic option that takes you directly over the best reefs and shipwrecks, offering clear views of the Red Sea's hidden treasures. 4. Unwind Like a Local: Evening Activities: After a day of exploring, Aqaba offers a relaxed, family-friendly nightlife. Walk the Corniche: Join the locals for an evening stroll along the Corniche (seaside promenade). Grab a fresh juice or a cup of strong Arabic coffee and enjoy the cool sea breeze. Stargazing: Due to its clear desert skies, Aqaba and the surrounding areas offer incredible stargazing opportunities. Head just outside the city lights for a truly spectacular view of the night sky. By focusing on these authentic, local things to do in Aqaba, you will move beyond the typical tourist itinerary and create memories that truly capture the spirit of Jordan.
