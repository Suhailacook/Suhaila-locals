    <div class="post-content">
      <p>The rumors are true—global superstar **Shakira** is coming to Jordan for the first time ever! On **March 28th, 2026**, the Red Sea will echo with the sounds of "Hips Don't Lie" and "Waka Waka" as she performs a historic live concert right here in Aqaba.</p>
      <p>Whether you're traveling from Amman, neighboring countries, or flying in from across the globe, this isn't just a concert—it's a chance to experience the magic of Jordan's coastal gem. As locals, we want to make sure your concert weekend is as authentic and delicious as possible.</p>

      <h2>1. Where to Eat Before the Show</h2>
      <p>Aqaba's food scene will be buzzing on concert day. Skip the hotel buffets and dive into the real flavors of the city.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-Concert Fuel:</strong> Grab a quick, world-class falafel sandwich from the downtown souk. It’s light enough to keep you dancing but filling enough to last through the encore.</li>
        <li><strong>The Local Favorite:</strong> For something truly unique, head to <strong>Abu Rebhi</strong> for their famous fries and eggplant sandwiches. It’s the ultimate Aqaba street food experience.</li>
        <li><strong>A Celebration Meal:</strong> If you're arriving a day early, treat yourself to <strong>Sayadieh</strong>, our signature spiced fish and rice dish. It's the taste of the Red Sea on a plate.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>Local Tip:</strong> Want to learn how to make these dishes yourself? Join our <a href="cookingclass.html">Authentic Cooking Class</a> on the morning of the concert! It’s the perfect way to spend your afternoon before heading to the venue.
      </div>

      <h2>2. Beyond the Music: Must-See Spots</h2>
      <p>Don't just come for the music; stay for the magic. If you have a few hours before the gates open, here’s how to spend them:</p>
      <p><strong>The Old Town Souk:</strong> Take a walk through the spice market. The scents of cardamom and sumac are the perfect sensory introduction to Jordan. It's also the best place to pick up unique, handmade souvenirs.</p>
      <p><strong>The Waterfront:</strong> Walk the Corniche as the sun sets. The golden hour in Aqaba is spectacular, especially with the anticipation of a major concert in the air.</p>
      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>Local Tip:</strong> The best way to see the city's hidden gems is our <a href="walkingtour.html">Aqaba Walking Tour</a>. We'll show you the spots that aren't on the tourist maps, including the best viewpoints for photos.
      </div>

      <h2>3. Practical Tips for Concert-Goers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dress for the Desert:</strong> March evenings in Aqaba are beautiful but can get a bit breezy by the sea. Bring a light layer for after the show.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Try the local <strong>Lemon with Mint</strong> juice. It’s incredibly refreshing and a Jordanian staple.</li>
        <li><strong>Book Early:</strong> With thousands of fans arriving, hotels and experiences will fill up fast. Make sure to secure your spot for a <a href="dinningexperience.html">Traditional Dining Experience</a> to celebrate after the big night!</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We are so excited to welcome Shakira and all her fans to our beautiful home. Let's make March 2026 a month to remember! <a href="Reservation.html">Book your local experiences now to complete your concert trip.</a></p>
