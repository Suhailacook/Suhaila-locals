      <p>Arriving at **King Hussein International Airport (AQJ)** is the first step of your Red Sea adventure. While the airport is small and easy to navigate, knowing your transport options ahead of time will save you stress and ensure you don't overpay. Here is our local guide to getting from the airport to downtown Aqaba in 2026.</p>

      <h2>1. The Airport Taxi (The Easiest Option)</h2>
      <p>Taxis are readily available right outside the arrivals hall 24/7. In Aqaba, airport taxis operate on a fixed-rate system to the city center, which makes things very simple for travelers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Estimated Cost:</strong> Approximately 10 - 15 JOD ($14 - $21 USD) to downtown Aqaba.</li>
        <li><strong>Duration:</strong> About 15 - 20 minutes depending on traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Tip:</strong> Always confirm the price with the driver before you get in, even though the rates are generally fixed. Most drivers are friendly and speak basic English.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Shuttle Services</h2>
      <p>While there isn't a traditional "city bus" from the airport, there are private shuttle services that can be pre-booked. This is a great option if you are traveling in a group or want a guaranteed door-to-door service.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Jordan Shuttle:</strong> Offers reliable transfers between the airport and various points in Aqaba and Tala Bay.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel Transfers:</strong> Many hotels in Aqaba offer their own shuttle services. Check with your accommodation when booking to see if they can arrange a pickup for you.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Car Rentals</h2>
      <p>If you plan to explore beyond Aqaba—perhaps heading to Wadi Rum or Petra—renting a car at the airport is a convenient choice. Several international and local agencies have desks at King Hussein International.</p>
      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>Local Tip:</strong> Driving in Aqaba is relatively easy compared to Amman. Just remember to have your international driving permit ready!
      </div>

      <h2>4. Arriving for a Local Experience?</h2>
      <p>If you've booked a <strong>Cooking Class</strong> or <strong>Walking Tour</strong> with us, let us know your arrival time! While we don't provide direct airport pickups, we can help you coordinate with trusted local drivers or give you the exact location to tell your taxi driver to ensure you arrive right at our doorstep.</p>

      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Once you drop your bags at the hotel, the best way to shake off the travel fatigue is a sunset walk on the Corniche followed by a fresh <strong>Lemon with Mint</strong> juice. Welcome to Aqaba!
