      <p>Jordan is a land of incredible hospitality, where guests are often treated like family. While many Jordanians in tourist areas speak excellent English, learning a few key Arabic phrases and understanding local customs will open doors to more authentic experiences and heartfelt smiles.</p>
      
      <p>Whether you're wandering through the ancient streets of Petra, camping under the stars in Wadi Rum, or enjoying the coastal charm of Aqaba, this guide will help you navigate Jordan like a local.</p>

      <h2>1. The Power of Greetings</h2>
      <p>In Jordan, greetings are more than just a "hello"—they are a sign of respect and a way to build an immediate connection.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A-Salaam Alaikum:</strong> This means "Peace be upon you." It is the universal greeting across the Arab world. You can also shorten it to just <strong>Salaam</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Wa-Alaikum-Salaam:</strong> This is the standard response to the greeting above, meaning "And upon you be peace."</li>
        <li><strong>Ahlan wa Sahlan:</strong> This means "Welcome." You will hear this constantly from shopkeepers, hosts, and even strangers on the street.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. Essential Daily Phrases</h2>
      <p>Having these simple words in your back pocket will make your daily interactions much smoother:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shukran:</strong> Thank you. It's the most important word to know!</li>
        <li><strong>Na’am:</strong> Yes. (You might also hear <strong>Na’am min fadlik</strong> for "Yes please").</li>
        <li><strong>La:</strong> No. If you are being pestered at a market, a polite <strong>"La shukran"</strong> (No thank you) is usually very effective.</li>
        <li><strong>In sha Allah:</strong> This means "God willing" or "If God wills." It’s used for anything in the future. If someone says "I hope you visit Jordan again," a perfect response is "In sha Allah."</li>
        <li><strong>Min fadlak (m) / Min fadlik (f):</strong> Please.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Cultural Etiquette: The Do's and Don'ts</h2>
      <p>Understanding local customs is just as important as the language itself. Here are some pro-tips for your visit:</p>
      
      <div class="local-tip">
        <strong>The Coffee Ritual:</strong> If a host offers you Arabic coffee, it's a sign of hospitality and it's polite to accept. If you've had enough and don't want a refill, gently shake your cup from side to side. If you want more, just hold your cup out!
      </div>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> It is polite to stand up when greeting others. Shaking hands is common, but be mindful that some conservative veiled women may prefer not to shake hands with men.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Space:</strong> Don't be surprised if people stand a bit closer during conversation than you might be used to in the West—it's a sign of engagement!</li>
        <li><strong>Ramadan Awareness:</strong> If you visit during the holy month of Ramadan, avoid eating, drinking, or smoking in public places during daylight hours out of respect for those fasting.</li>
        <li><strong>Tipping:</strong> In restaurants, a 10% tip is standard if service isn't included. For taxis, rounding up the fare is appreciated but not required.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Dining Like a Local</h2>
      <p>Food is the heart of Jordanian culture. When dining out, remember that sharing is caring! Most meals are served family-style, and your host might even insist on "over-feeding" you—it's their way of showing generosity.</p>
