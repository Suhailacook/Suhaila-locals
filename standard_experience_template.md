## Design and Style Guide

### Typography
The template uses a single, highly readable, and professional sans-serif font for consistency and modern appeal.

| Element | Font Recommendation | Style | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Font** | **Work Sans** or **Inter** | Sans-Serif | Excellent readability and modern, professional aesthetic. |
| **H1 (Title)** | Work Sans, Bold | 48pt - 64pt | Immediate impact and clear identification. |
| **H2 (Section)** | Work Sans, Semi-Bold | 24pt - 32pt | Clear separation of content sections. |
| **Body Text** | Work Sans, Regular | 16pt - 18pt | High readability for detailed descriptions. |

### Color Palette
A clean, neutral base with a single, professional accent color for high-impact elements.

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code (Example) | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Clean White | `#FFFFFF` | Dominant background for a minimalist feel. |
| **Text** | Charcoal Black | `#1A1A1A` | Primary text color for high contrast. |
| **Accent/CTA** | Professional Teal | `#008080` | **Call-to-Action buttons**, links, and key highlights. |
| **Secondary** | Light Gray | `#F0F0F0` | Section separators, background for quick facts. |

### Layout Principles
1.  **High-Resolution Hero:** The top of the page must feature a full-width, high-quality image or video.
2.  **Ample White Space:** Generous padding and margins around all elements to reduce clutter and draw attention to content.
3.  **Sticky CTA:** The booking module (Price, Duration, "Book Now") should be easily accessible, ideally "sticky" on scroll on desktop, and a prominent fixed bar on mobile.
